# Haptic-Feedback-Cane

# Project Overview
The Haptic Feedback Cane is a cutting-edge assistive device designed to improve the navigation and mobility of individuals with visual impairments. This project represents an innovative convergence of various technologies, including ultrasonic sensors, advanced imaging systems, and haptic feedback mechanisms. By integrating these elements, the cane offers a unique solution for obstacle detection and navigation assistance.

# Technical Details
## Edge Detection and Image Processing
Utilizes computer vision algorithms, primarily focusing on edge detection, to identify and classify obstacles.
Cameras integrated into the cane provide real-time visual data, which is processed to detect edges, shapes, and specific features like crosswalks and curbs.
The system is designed to operate effectively in different lighting conditions, enhancing its reliability and usability.

## Ultrasonic Sensing for Obstacle Detection
Ultrasonic sensors are employed to detect objects in the cane's path, providing an additional layer of spatial awareness.
These sensors help in determining the distance to and size of obstacles, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the surroundings.

## Haptic Feedback System
The cane translates visual and ultrasonic data into tactile feedback through integrated vibration motors.
This haptic feedback informs the user about the proximity and nature of obstacles, enhancing spatial awareness and decision-making in real-time.
